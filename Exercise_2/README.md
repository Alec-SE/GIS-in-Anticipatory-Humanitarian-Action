**Exercise 2**

In this scenario, we will create an overview map of the prevalence of stunting in Sierra Leone at the district level. For this reason, we will visualise both the prevalence of stunting and key infrastructure such as hospitals, airports and roads. The final decision on which data to visualise and in which way is up to you, the cartographer.  

**Aim of the exercise**

Gather first experiences with the visualization tools of QGIS.
Obtain the skills to produce a printable map with QGIS.

**Data:**

Download the [data]() and save it on your PC. Create a local folder and save the above data there. (.zip folders must be unzipped beforehand.)


- [Sierra Leone prevalence of stunting 2014 (data modified)](https://geonode.wfp.org/layers/geonode%3Asle_ica_malnutrition_geonode_20170517) (Polygons) 
- [Sierra Leone national boders](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/geoboundaries-admin-boundaries-for-sierra-leone) (lines)
- [Sierra Leone provinces](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/geoboundaries-admin-boundaries-for-sierra-leone) (Lines)
- [Sierra Leone health](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/sierra-leone-healthsites) (Points)
- [Sierra Leone airports](Sierra Leone airports) (Points) 

**Tasks**
1. Open the above files in QGIS. Load the vector layers into your programme.
2. Classify the stunting data and adjust the coloring. See wiki [Classification of data- Classification of ordinal scaled data](https://gitlab.com/Alec-SE/gis-in-anticipatory-humanitarian-action/-/wikis/Classification-of-data)
3. Chose symbology and colors for borders, roads, hospitals and airports which seems fit to you. See wiki [Styling panel](https://gitlab.com/Alec-SE/gis-in-anticipatory-humanitarian-action/-/wikis/Styling-panel)
4.
